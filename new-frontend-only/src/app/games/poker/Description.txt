### **Features:**
1. **Multiplayer Gameplay**:
   - The game supports multiplayer mode, allowing players to compete against each other.
   - Players are likely able to join the game either through a lobby or a match-queue system.
   
2. **Poker Game Setup**:
   - The game is a classic **Poker** game where players compare hands to determine the winner.
   - The rules of Poker, such as betting rounds and card ranking, are likely implemented in the backend, though the specific rules are marked as "Poker rules" in the config file.

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - The game uses the **Mina blockchain** for its backend, which is likely used for managing game transactions, verifying player actions, or tracking the status of the game. However, the backend integration with Mina is temporarily commented out in the code.
   - The frontend could potentially interact with the blockchain once the backend code is set up, such as handling player wagers or ensuring fairness.

4. **Game View Components**:
   - The game is managed and displayed in the `Poker.tsx` component, where the logic for starting the game, managing players, and displaying the game interface resides.
   - The `Poker.tsx` component connects to other components for displaying the game interface, such as the list of players and chat logs, ensuring smooth interaction during gameplay.
   
5. **UI/UX Components**:
   - The app includes multiple UI components, such as:
     - **Chat** and **Logs Messages**: For player communication during the game.
     - **Player List**: Displays the players in the current game or lobby.
     - **Rules Accordion**: Likely provides easy access to the game’s rules, assisting players in understanding how to play.

6. **Temporary Runtime Modules**:
   - There’s a placeholder for runtime modules in the `config.ts`, indicating that future game modules or dynamic features might be integrated (perhaps for handling different rounds of play, player actions, etc.).

7. **Game Page & External URL**:
   - The game has its own dedicated page (`Poker.tsx`) within the app, which is accessible via the `externalUrl` property.

### **How the Game is Played:**
While the specific game mechanics are not fully detailed in the provided code, here's a general outline based on the `Poker.tsx` file structure and typical poker gameplay:

1. **Game Lobby**:
   - Players will likely join a lobby, where they can either create or join a match.
   - The lobby component might allow players to select settings (like game type or buy-in amounts) before starting the game.

2. **Game Start**:
   - Once the players are ready, they can start the game. The `useStartGame.ts` hook is likely responsible for initiating the game, such as dealing cards and handling the game flow.

3. **Dealing Cards and Betting**:
   - Each player receives their cards, and the game enters a betting round. The players place their wagers based on the strength of their hands, which are compared against other players’ hands.

4. **Rounds of Betting**:
   - In typical poker, there are multiple rounds of betting, where players can either call, raise, or fold based on their hands.
   - These actions could be reflected through the app’s UI components such as buttons or cards.

5. **Determining the Winner**:
   - After the final betting round, the remaining players reveal their cards, and the winner is determined based on poker hand rankings (e.g., flush, straight, pair, etc.).
   - The winner might be decided in the backend (once blockchain integration is set up), ensuring fair play and accurate determination of the best hand.

6. **Multiplayer Interaction**:
   - Players can interact with each other via chat messages and logs. The app’s **ChatMessage** and **LogsMessage** components will allow players to communicate during the game, potentially for strategic discussions or casual interaction.

7. **Handling Blockchain Transactions** (When implemented):
   - The backend (currently commented out) will likely interact with the blockchain for various transactions, such as verifying player bets, ensuring fairness, or settling the game’s results.
   - Smart contracts or Mina blockchain features might be used for secure and verifiable game operations.
