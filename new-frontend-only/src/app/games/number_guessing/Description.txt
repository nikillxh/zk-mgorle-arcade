#### **How the Game is Played:**
1. **Game Setup**:  
   - One player enters a number to "hide."  
   - The game hashes the number (originally using Poseidon hash on Mina blockchain).  
   - The second player then tries to guess the hidden number.  

2. **Gameplay Flow**:  
   - If the guessed number matches the hidden number, the player wins.  
   - If incorrect, the game informs the player and allows another attempt.  
   - The UI updates dynamically to reflect the game state.  

3. **Score Tracking**:  
   - Player scores are updated based on correct guesses.  
   - Originally, scores were stored on the Mina blockchain (now a placeholder for a new blockchain).
